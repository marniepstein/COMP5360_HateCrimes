    "# Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "We hope to answer the following question in this analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the demographics of hate crime offenders and victims? What are the main types of biases driving hate crimes? \n",
    "\n",
    "    * What trends exist for these measures? \n",
    "    * Do these measures and trends vary by state and region? \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Can we predict whether states passed government resolutions condeming AAPI hate crimes based on state hate crime rates and hate group rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is media depiction of hate crimes correlated to hate crime rates? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of hate crimes in the United States reached its highest level in a decade, according to data from the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2020-hate-crime-statistics) (FBI). In 2020, the FBI reported 7,554 hate crime incidents involving 10,528 victims. The majority (62%) of victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity, with another 20% of victims targeted because of sexual orientation bias and 13% targeted because of religious bias.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hate crimes have received increased media attention since 2020. This has been driven in part by high profile hate crimes motivated by racial bias against Black Americans, such as the murder of [Ahmaud Arbery](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-jury-finds-three-men-guilty-hate-crimes-connection-pursuit-and-killing-ahmaud-arbery), and the [surge](https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/the-us-is-seeing-a-massive-spike-in-anti-asian-hate-crimes.html) in hate crimes targeting [Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders](https://stopaapihate.org/national-report-through-december-31-2021/) (AAPI) during the Covid-19 pandemic, likely connected to racist rhetoric around the virus. To address this surge, many states have passed government resolutions opposing hate against AAPI indivduals.\n",
    "As of August 2021, 41 states had passed a resolution at some level of government (state, county, or municipal) and 22 states had passed a resolution at the state-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project focused on analyzing data about hate crimes to answer key questions. Hate crime data from the FBI was analyzed in an attempt to identify trends between hate crimes. In particular, state, type of location, bias type, offender race, and offense description will be examined. We aimed to determine if state rates of hate crimes and hate groups can predict whether a state passed a government resolutions opposing hate crimes. Lastly, we web scraped news sources to measure media attention around hate crimes. We examined the correlation between hate crime rates and media attention towards hate crimes. The overarching goal of this project was to illuminate aspects and trends regarding hate crimes that are not obvious to spread awareness of these trends. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We used data from several sources, including the FBI’s hate crime data, Stop AAPI Hate’s database on government resolutions opposing hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), and the Southern Poverty Law Center’s data on hate crime groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FBI Hate Crime Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [FBI database](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/downloads) has a Crime Data Explorer that provides data on all recorded hate crimes since 1991 through 2020. This data includes type of hate crime, data on the offending group, data on the victim group, location, state, and date.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains 219,577 records of hate crimes since 1991, including 10,299 records from 2020. Data on hate crimes are collected as part of the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report (UCR) data collection. Law enforcement agencies report hate crimes to the FBI monthly or quarterly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Crimes are only classified as hate crimes when a law enforcement investigation “reveals sufficient evidence to lead a reasonable and prudent person to conclude that the offender’s actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by his or her bias,” according to Hate Crime Statistics, 2020 Methodology. Because of this, the number of reported hate crimes in this data should be considered an underestimate of the number of true hate crimes. However, because all historical hate crime data is subject to this same bias, analyses are revealing of overall trends and rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Southern Poverty Law Center Hate Group Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/) (SPLC) tracks hate groups in the United States. They publish yearly [datasets](https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map) of hate groups. For each hate group, they include the name of the hate group, city, state, ideology, whether the chapter is the group’s headquarters, and whether the group is statewide. Data is available from 2000 to 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stop AAPI Hate 50 State Survey on Government Resolutions Opposing Hate Crimes Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Stop AAPI Hate](https://stopaapihate.org/) coalition published a [50 state survey](https://stopaapihate.org/resources/) tracking government resolutions opposing hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. This dataset contains resolutions passed at the federal, state, county, municipal, and school district levels as of August 2021. For each level of government, the dataset contains a record for every geographic entity (i.e. the state dataset contains a row for every state, the county dataset contains a row for every county, etc). Each record indicates whether that government entity published a resolution against AAPI hate, and if so, contains a link to the resolution, the enacting body (i.e. Senate, State Assembly, City Council), the date of enactment, and the current status if not enacted.\n",
    "\n",

    "**The United States Department of Justice: Justice News**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [The United States Department of Justice search query](https://www.justice.gov/news?sort=field_pr_date&order=desc&keys=hate%20crime&items_per_page=25) allows for the filtering of articles pertaining to certain topics. When sorted for Hate Crime, all articles relating to this topic are displayed. There are over 15 pages with 50 articles per page. Each of these articles have their titles, article snippet, and date posted displayed. The articles are arranged by 'Relevance' by default, but can also be adjusted to sort by 'Date'.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Summary of Methods \n",
    "\n",
    "This project has several sections of analysis. A brief summary of methods for each section is provided below along with a link to the full analysis, which includes data processing, exploratory analysis, and analysis methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hate crime trends**\n",
    "   \n",
    "Based on the data from the FBI website, we created various graphs in an attempt to identify any trends or correlations between several factors and hate crimes. These factors included location, state, offender race, victim bias, month/year, and type of crime. This data was be used in conjunction with the government resolutions against AAPI hate data and media attention towards hate crime data, as described in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full data processing in these Jupyter notebook: [Proportion of Hate Crimes and Trends](Proportion_of_Hate_Crimes_and_Trends.ipynb), and [Total Hate Crimes Since 1991](Total_Hate_Crimes_Since_1991.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Government resolutions against AAPI hate**\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a state-level dataset that merged together multiple data sources. This dataset contained information on government resolutions and statements published against AAPI hate, from the Stop AAPI Hate dataset, including the number of resolutions passed at the state, county, and municipal levels, and whether any resolution was passed in the state. It also contained data on hate groups by state and by year, from the SPLC’s data on hate groups. Lastly, we  used the FBI data on hate crimes (described above) to measure hate crime numbers in 2020, including counts of hate crimes overall and hate crimes committed against an AAPI victim. We convert hate crime counts and hate group counts to state per capita measures. We also include a measure of statewide political leaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using KNearestNeighbors and SVM, we created classification models to test whether we could create a prediction model of whether a state passed a resolution against AAPI hate. We examined multiple models and mutliple outcome variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full data processing in this Jupyter notebook: [Classification Models for Government Resolutions.](Resolutions_and_Hate_Groups.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Media attention towards hate crimes**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dates for all the articles on the Justice.gov website was collected and inputted into a dictionary as a 'Datetime' object with the years as the keys and each month's total articles posted as the values. \n",
    "Additionally, a csv created from the FBI data containing the hate crimes committed per month was read and aranged into a list. Multiple graphics were generated such as hate crime articles posted per month and hate crimes committed vs hate crime articles posted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression was performed on some of the graphics to determine if variance is explaied by different variables. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Summary of Results \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hate crime trends**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from the FBI website was collected and cleaned. All non-numerical attributes were converted into numerical categorizations. Visualizations were created, such as proportional charts for number of offenses for each offender race, bias description, location of the crime, and state in which the crime occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of the groups defined as White, Black/African American, Asian, Multiple, Unknown, or Other by the FBI website, 71.5% of hate crimes were committed by white groups, and 23.6% were committed by Black/African American groups. 34.1% of whom the crimes were committed against were towards Black/African American groups, 12.8% were committed against Jewish groups, and 11.5% were committed against white groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the recorded crimes, 16.5% were located in California, 9.6% in New Jersey, and 9.1% in New York. The most common locations for hate crimes to occur are in residential homes at 37.1%, on or by a street at 23.6%, and at schools for 9.9%. The most common types of hate crimes were simple assault at 46.8%, 29.8% intimidation, and 12.6% robbery. \n",
    "\n",
    "The largest proportion of hate crimes were committed in 2020 at 4.7%, followed by 2001 at 4.4%. The spike in crimes in 2020 may be attributed to crimes that launched the Stop AAPI Hate movement, and the spike in 2001 was likely a result of backlash against 9/11 towards Arab groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a monthly basis, more hate crimes tend to be committed in the summer months, and fewer in winter. December consistently has the fewest number of hate crimes committed, while September and October are the highest. Overall, the most hate crimes are committed in September at 10.1%, however if 2001 is excluded from the data set, October becomes the highest month for rates of hate crimes at 9.6%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Government resolutions against AAPI hate**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, data on hate groups was read into Python and aggregated by year. Annual trends were plotted. The number of hate crime groups increased from 599 in 2000 to 1018 in 2011. The number of hate groups then dipped down to 784 in 2014, and sharply increased again to 1020 in 2018. In recent years, the number again decreased to 733 in 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of hate groups was next aggregated by state and by year. First, we mapped the number of hate groups by state in 2020 using the plotly package. This map revealed that California and Florida had the highest number of hate groups in 2020 (around 70), followed by Texas (54). We then used the plotly package to create an interactive map of hate groups by state, with a feature on the bottom allowing the user to choose a year from 2000 to 2021 or to animate the map over this time period. This map shows that California, Florida and Texas remain the three states with the highest number of hate groups during the time period, but that the south had a higher number of hate groups relative to other states in the 2000s, with the difference less extreme after 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data on government resolutions against AAPI hate was read into Python as three separate datasets based on the government level (state, county, and municipal). For each, records were condensed to the state-level. Variables were created to indicate the number of resolutions at each level of government for each state. Variables were also created to indicate the total number of resolutions in that state (at any level of government) and a binary variable indicating whether the state passed any resolution at any level. Overall, 41 states passed a resolution or statement at any level and 22 states passed a resolution at the state level. \n",
    "\n",
    "A scatterplot matrix did not reveal any strong correlations between the variables of interest. PCA revealed that the first principal component held nearly half of all explained variance. We plotted the data in two- and one-dimmension, revealing that New Jersey may be an outlier. We then created classification models using SVM and KNearestNeighbors classifiers, examining models with two different outcome variables (whether the state passed a resolution at the state-level and at any level of government), and creating separate models with and without the outlier, New Jersey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, both SVM and KNearestNeighbors classifiers did a good job of predicting whether a resolution will be passed in a state at any level of government. Both models, with and without New Jersey (the outlier), had an accuracy of 0.8-0.84. The classifier models do not do a great job of predicting whether a state government will pass a resolution against AAPI hate at the state level. Both classifiers only had an accuracy of 0.6 with New Jersey and 0.57 without New Jersey.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Media attention towards hate crimes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Article posting dates were collected for all articles available under \"The United Sates Department of Justice\" news search query, returning about 750 articles. The article dates range from January 2009 to April 2022. \n",
    "When plotted, it was not easy to determine any trends, but the number of articles posted per month appears to be random. \n",
    "\n",
    "A csv was generated from the FBI data containing the hate crimes committed per month from 1991 to 2020. As the two data sets do not cover the same range, both were adjusted to cover the same time frames of 2009 to 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot was generated from 2009 to 2020 with number of articles vs the number of hate crimes. Linear regression was performed on this plot. We find there is an R-squared value of 0.700, meaning that 70.0% of the variation in number of articles posted can be explaied by the number of hate crimes posted per month. The coefficient was small but significant, showing that for an increase in 100 hate crimes we would expect to see only 0.6 additional news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were a handful of outliers that all origniated from 2020 with a high of 1470 hate crimes committed in June. When the model was re-run with 2020 removed, the R-squared increased to 0.776 which means 7.6% more of the variation is explained by the number of hate crimes committed. The coefficient is slightly higher, 0.0073 instead of 0.0063, showing a small, but positive effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these models shows a small, positive relationship between the number of hate crimes committed and the number of articles being written.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hate crime trends** For this data, hate crimes were counted for the variables: location, victim bias, offender race, month, state, and type of crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Government resolutions against AAPI hate**\n",
    "To evaluate our classification models, we used cross validation and examined the accuracy score on the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Media attention towards hate crimes**\n",
    "R-squared values are generated from performing linear regression on different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ethical Data Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "The main ethical concern surrounding this project is that this is a sensitive topic surrounding racial issues. We are cognizant that our biases that may influence our findings and interpretation, and we have aimed to strictly adhere to the data collected rather than personal opinions. Importantly, all findings can only be viewed as associates or correlations; no findings in this analysis indicate causation. Findings do not imply that individuals from certain groups are more or less likely to commit hate crimes; aggregate findings should not be used to discriminate or hold biases against individuals or demographic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data used in this analysis is available publicly. As such, there are no ethical data concerns surrounding the use of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Project Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we analyzed multiple sources of data about hate crimes to examine trends in hate crimes, predict whether states passed government resolutions against AAPI hate, and measure the correlation between hate crimes and media mention towards hate crimes. We conducted an in-depth exploratory analysis of the hate crime data, created classification models to predict whether state had passed government resolutions, and conducted a regression analysis of the effects of hate crime numbers on media mentions. Overall, we found that around 70% of hate crimes were committed by white groups, a third of hate crimes occured in residential homes, and hate crimes are more commonly committed in the summer months. SVM and KNearestNeighbors classifiers did a good job of predicting whether a resolution was passed in a state at any level of government (accuracy of 0.8-0.84), but did not do a great job of predicting whether a state government passed a resolution against AAPI hate at the state level (accuracy of 0.6). Regression models showed a small, positive relationship between the number of hate crimes committed and the number of articles being written. Classification results were evaluated with cross validation and accuracy scores and regression results were evaluated with R-squared values and p-values. In the future, we would like to expand this analysis to include other news sources, such as Twitter and other main media sources.\n"
